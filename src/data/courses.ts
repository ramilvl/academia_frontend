  description: "Learn the structure and syntax of HTML to build web content.",
  content: `
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of any web page. It defines the structure of content by using tags and elements. Elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, and forms are all created using HTML. Browsers interpret HTML to display the webpage visually.

For example, the <head> element contains metadata, and the <body> contains the visible content. Understanding semantic HTML is important for accessibility and SEO.

HTML documents are made up of nested elements that give meaning and structure to the page content. The basic structure includes the doctype declaration, html root element, head, and body sections.

Some common tags and their purposes:
- <h1> to <h6>: Headings of different levels
- <p>: Paragraphs for text blocks
- <a>: Hyperlinks to navigate between pages or resources
- <img>: Embedding images into the page
- <ul> and <ol>: Unordered and ordered lists respectively
- <li>: List items inside ul or ol
- <form>: Collect user input via form controls like <input>, <textarea>, <select>, and <button>

Semantic HTML tags provide meaningful structure that helps search engines and assistive technologies understand the content. Examples include <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, and <section>.

HTML attributes provide additional information about elements, such as:
- href in <a> tags to specify the URL of the link
- src and alt in <img> tags to specify the image source and alternative text
- class and id to add CSS styling or JavaScript hooks

HTML5 introduced many new elements and APIs, enhancing the capabilities of web pages, including:
- <video> and <audio> for multimedia embedding
- <canvas> for graphics rendering
- Geolocation, drag and drop, local storage, and offline web applications APIs

Learning HTML is the first step toward web development and is often combined with CSS for styling and JavaScript for behavior.

Remember to always write valid, well-formed HTML for best browser compatibility and performance.

Hereâ€™s an example of a simple HTML document structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph explaining my site.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit example.com</a>
</body>
</html>

Practice writing HTML code to get comfortable with tags, nesting, and attributes. Use developer tools in browsers to inspect and debug HTML.

Understanding HTML thoroughly will make learning CSS and JavaScript easier since they build on this foundation.

        content: `
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the presentation of HTML elements. It allows you to change colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, and responsive behavior of a webpage. 

CSS selectors target HTML elements, and properties define the styles applied. For example, you can set background-color, font-size, margins, and flexbox for layouts. 

CSS cascading rules and specificity determine which styles take precedence. Learning responsive design with media queries helps create mobile-friendly sites.

        content: `
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces using components. Components are reusable pieces of UI that can hold their own state and logic.

React uses JSX, which allows you to write HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript. React updates the UI efficiently using a virtual DOM, minimizing real DOM manipulations for performance.

React hooks like useState and useEffect let you add state and lifecycle behaviors in functional components. Understanding props and state management is key to building React apps.
